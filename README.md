# InstaJam

InstaJam Created by Fernando Garcia

Program takes an amplified microphone signal, characterizes the musical notes in it and prints the key of the song for the user to play along with.

Should build in Windows with Visual Studio 2008-2012. Should build on Linux and OSX platforms with the use of C++11 std::chrono. Thanks to whackashoe for the cross-platform port.
